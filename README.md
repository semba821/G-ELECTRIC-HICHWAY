G-ELECTRIC HIGHWAY 

As a response to the global energy crisis, we developed an innovative idea to harvest wasted mechanical energy from daily road traffic—cars and pedestrians—by using Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) technology.

TENG works by generating electric current through the friction and separation of two materials with different charges. We chose the contact-separation mode, ideal for road traffic.

TENG Advantages:
	•	Doesn’t rely on sun, wind, or water.
	•	Operates with simple mechanical motion.
	•	Environmentally friendly, low-cost, and easy to implement.

Project Design:
A flexible TENG module is placed beneath the asphalt layer. When a vehicle passes, it creates pressure and friction, generating electrical charges that are collected and stored in batteries.

Materials Used:
	•	Sheep wool (positive layer): natural, durable, increases charge generation.
	•	Recycled polypropylene (negative layer): attracts electrons and retains charge.
	•	Aluminum foil (conductive layer): transfers the charge to the circuit.
	•	Additives: graphite, mineral sand, zinc oxide, and conductive cement for enhanced performance.

Future Applications:
	•	Powering smart lighting and traffic sensors.
	•	Integration with solar panels for higher energy output.
	•	Best suited for high-traffic roads and smart cities.
Results :
	•	A single TENG unit can generate up to 10 mW.
	•	Scalable systems can exceed 100 W/m².
	•	Can offset up to 30% of public energy usage and reduce e-waste by 60%.

Conclusion:
Roads can be more than just transportation routes—they can become smart, sustainable energy sources using accessible, low-cost materials and cutting-edge TENG technology.
